	<h3>Department of Civil & Environmental System Engineering</h3>
		<p>The Department of Civil & Environmental System Engineering at Konkuk University (KU) is built on a unique incorporation in its academic services of the five pillars of relevant higher engineering education âˆ’ information technology, global perspective, innovation, integration (of environmental and social issues), and industrial partnership.</p>
		<p>Within this framework, the department's efforts are directed at establishing a holistic academic portfolio that spans not only the regiments of a traditional civil engineering curriculum but also the integration of such subject areas as environment-related courses as well as agricultural civil engineering. Our offerings lead to the award of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and Master of Science (M.S.) degrees.</p>
